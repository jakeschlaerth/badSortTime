this python3 file should be run as a script. It will prompt the user to input a value for alpha as a decimal between 0 and 1.
There is some input validation included, as well as a warning if you enter an alpha parameters below .5.
It will sort random arrays and output the time taken to sort each to the console. The length of the arrays will also
depend on the alpha value entered.
